description: "My personal astrophotography website"
detail_description: "I started doing astrophotography in 2019. While I did share my images on platforms such as AstroBin or Instagram, I wanted my own website where I could share my work. I also wanted to have complete control and freedom over its design and function, down to the code. In late 2025, I decided to take it as an opportunity to learn more about programming and web development, though I didn't want to create it from absolute scratch either. I then learned about static site generators, such as Jekyll, which really streamline the process of getting a site up and running but still allow complete customization.  After much trial and error, this became my first website!"
