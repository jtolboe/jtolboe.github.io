description: "A simple web app for storing or managing bookmarks"
detail_description: "Continuing with wanting to study more about web development/general programming I decided to make an application using the Flask framework. What the app actually did was less important to me than the features I wanted to explore through it. Specifically I wanted to see in practice what looks like to be 'full stack', have user login and authentication, have data persistence such as reading and writing to a database, etc. I also used this project for the opportunity to learn about various deployment options such as docker, and the workflow of development to production. I first hosted it on an Amazon EC2 instance simply to check out AWS. I've sinced moved it to a Raspberry Pi where it runs in a docker container."
